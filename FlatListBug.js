In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a complex data structure or a large dataset.  The issue might not manifest immediately, but after many renders or updates, the list might start displaying incorrect data or experiencing unexpected behavior. This is often due to inefficient data updates or improper key management within the FlatList.  For instance, if you update only a part of the data, the component might not re-render efficiently or at all, even though the data has changed. Another common issue is the lack of a unique `key` prop for each item, which can lead to incorrect item rendering and recycling behavior.
