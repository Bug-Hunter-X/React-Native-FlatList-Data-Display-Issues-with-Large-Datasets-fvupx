# React Native FlatList Data Display Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native's `FlatList` component involving incorrect data display after multiple updates or when dealing with large datasets. The issue arises from inefficient data handling and lack of proper key management. This example shows the bug and then implements a solution.

## Bug Description
The `FlatList` may show incorrect data or unexpected behavior after multiple updates or when the data changes. This is often not apparent immediately, only after many data operations, and may be caused by inefficient data handling or lack of unique keys for items.

## Solution
The solution focuses on optimizing data updates and ensuring unique keys for each item within the `FlatList`. In this example, we add an unique ID to each data item.
